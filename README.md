A easy to configure waywall config

> [!CAUTION]
> This config is very WIP. It may break at any time with any update!!

## Installation

First, backup your previous config if you have one:
`mv ~/.config/waywall ~/.config/waywall.bkp`

Afterwards, clone the repository into the waywall config folder:
`git clone https://github.com/burandby/easywall.git ~/.config/waywall`
